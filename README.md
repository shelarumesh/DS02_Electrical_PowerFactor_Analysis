# Project-01  Electrical study
Electrical dataset Linear Regression
implimented CRISP_DM methodology

# Step No 01 : Undurstand the Business Problem
In the electrical system or utility power factor is very importance to save electrical energy.
In this dataset we will take and study only relation between Power and Power Factor.
From the Active, Apparant and Reactive Power we try to calculate Power Factor

# Step No 02 : Undurstanding the Data
Active Power - This is the actual power require to the system work. base on this power most of the electrical equipments are working.

Reactive Power - The role of this power and importance of this power is very less as compare to Active power.

Apparant Power - addition of Active and Reactive Power

Power Factor - Relation between Active and reactive power , PF=1 means reactive power consumption is less and Active power is equal to apparent power

# Step No 03 : Data PreProcessing
Data Cleaning : Selected only avg values from the dataset which is related to the powwr factor 

Data Wrangling : Not required 

Featurs Selection :  selected those fields which are importants

Data Visualisation : visualize the data and understand its currents, power, reactive, apparant, power factor and voltage relationship

# Step No 04 : Exploratory Data Analysis
Observed the trends of the data, from this analysis focusing on the power factors and its relations with other parameters 

# Step No 5 and 6 : Modelling and Evolution : 
Implemented Simple linear regression and its Regularization techniques and evaluated each model accuracy. Optimize the model with hyperparameter tunning and select best tunning factor and learning rate of the model.
