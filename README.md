# Project-01  Electrical study
Electrical dataset Linear Regression
implimented CRISP_DM methodology

# Step No 01 : Undurstand the Business Problem
In the electrical system or utility power factor is very importance to save electrical energy.
In this dataset we will take and study only relation between Power and Power Factor.
From the Active, Apparant and Reactive Power we try to calculate Power Factor

# Step No 02 : Undurstanding the Data
Active Power - This is the actual power require to the system work. base on this power most of the electrical equipments are working.
Reactive Power - The role of this power and importance of this power is very less as compare to Active power.
Apparant Power - addition of Active and Reactive Power
Power Factor - Relation between Active and reactive power , PF=1 means reactive power consumption is less and Active power is equal to apparent power

# Step No 03 : Data PreProcessing
Data Cleaning
Data Wrangling
Featurs Selection
Data Visualisation

# Step No 04 : Exploratory Data Analysis

# Step No 5 and 6 : Modelling and Evolution
